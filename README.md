# fract-ol
My really epic fract-ol\n
It displays mandelbrot and Julias, and can zoom to mouse position.\n
Used minimal c libraries and MLX42 (codam library built on openGL) for the graphics

to run the program, you first need to have glfw installed

then\n
run "make" in the root directory\n
run the program with "./fractol" and an option ("./fractol mandelbrot" for example)\n
without input the "./fractol" will display tips and options\n
